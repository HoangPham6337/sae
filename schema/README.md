# Project Documentation

This repository contains the core schemas and diagrams for the project, covering both database structures and sequence flows. These assets are organized into dedicated folders for easy navigation.

## Folder Structure

### 1. `database_schema`
This folder contains the database design for the project. It includes:
- **`database_schema.drawio`**: The editable Draw.io file for the database schema.
- **`database_schema.png`**: The rendered PNG image of the database schema.

### 2. `sequence_schema`
This folder includes the source code and images for sequence diagrams created using [SequenceDiagram.org](https://sequencediagram.org/). It contains:
- `.txt` files: Source code for the sequence diagrams.
- `.png` files: Rendered images of the sequence diagrams.

### How to Use
1. For database editing or viewing:
   - Use the Draw.io file in the `database_schema` folder for modifications.
   - Refer to the PNG file for a quick view of the schema.
2. For sequence diagrams:
   - Use the `.txt` files in the `sequence_schema` folder to update or recreate diagrams on SequenceDiagram.org.
   - Check the `.png` files for the rendered diagrams.
